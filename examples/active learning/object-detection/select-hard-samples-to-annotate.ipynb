    "*This notebook shows you how to plug your ML model in Encord Active to rank the images according to an acquisition function.\n",

    "### The  Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have an image dataset consist of different airplanes. You want to train an object detector model to get the bounding boxes of the planes and later crop those regions to create a collage of airplanes pictures.\n",
    "[Here](https://storage.googleapis.com/encord-active-notebook-demos/airplanes-active-learning-demo.zip), we have an Encord Active project like this. Download the zipped folder, extract it, and run encord active in the project folder or its parent folder to visualize this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the Encord-Active app, run the following command:\n",
    "`encord-active visualize`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can visualize the images according to certain image-level metrics in the Data Quality -> Explorer page.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 799 images in the dataset; however, you do not want to label all of them, which is quite cumbersome. You only want to label the first 50 and you want to select the best 50 images that will give you the best outcome in terms of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an active learning workflow, you generally have a model trained on a few initial labeled samples. In this notebook, for the simplicity, we will use a HuggingFace YOLOS-tiny model that is trained on COCO dataset, in which there is an `airplane` class! So, we will use the YOLOS-tiny model's output for the `airplane` class to rank the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an acquisition function, you will use Encord Active's `AverageFrameScore`. This acquisition function gets the average confidence scores of the predictions in each image, if there is no prediction, it assigns zero. You think that in all of your images there is at least one airplane, so this acquisition function is very suitable for your task. If the score is low, model is having difficulty in detecting airplanes in those images, so you may want to collect these samples to label next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start, you will see how easy to do that with Encord Active!"
