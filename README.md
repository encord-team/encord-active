## ‚ùì What is Encord Active?

[Encord Active][encord-active-landing] is an open-source active learning framework to help you find failure modes in your models and improve your data quality and model performance.

Use Encord Active to visualise your data, evaluate your models, surface model failure modes, find labeling mistakes, prioritize high-value data for re-labeling and more!

## üí° When to use Encord Active?

Encord Active helps you understand and improve your data, labels, and models at all stages of your computer vision journey.
Whether you've just started collecting data, labeled your first batch of samples, or have multiple models in production.

## Installation

The simplest way to install the CLI is using `pip` in a suitable virtual environment:

```shell
pip install encord-active
```

We recommend using a virtual environment, such as `venv`:

```shell
python3.9 -m venv ea-venv
source ea-venv/bin/activate
pip install encord-active
```

> `encord-active` requires [python3.9][python-39].
> If you have trouble installing `encord-active`, you find more detailed instructions on
> installing it [here][encord-active-docs].

## üëã Quick start

Get started immediately by sourcing your environment and running the code below.
This downloads a small dataset and launches the Encord Active App for you to explore:

```shell
encord-active quickstart
```

After opening the UI, we recommend you to head to the [workflow documentation][encord-active-docs-workflow] to see some common workflows.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è¬† Downloading a pre-built project

The quickest way to get started is by downloading an existing dataset.
The download command will ask which pre-built dataset to use and will download it into a new directory in the current working directory.

```shell
$ encord-active download
$ cd /path/of/downloaded/project
$ encord-active visualise
```

The app should then open in the browser.
If not, navigate to [`localhost:8501`](http://localhost:8501).
Our [docs][encord-active-docs] contains more information about what you can see in the page.

## <img width="24" height="24" src="resources/logo.png"/> Importing an Encord Project

This section requires [setting up an ssh key][encord-docs-ssh] with Encord, so slightly more technical.

> If you haven't set up an ssh key with Encord, you can follow the tutorial in [this¬†link][encord-docs-ssh].

To import an Encord project, use this command:

`$ encord-active import project`

> There are also options for importing projects from, e.g,. KITTI, CVAT, and COCO. Find more details in [the documentation][encord-active-docs-workflow-import-data].

## ‚≠ê Concepts and features

### üìä Quality metric

Quality metric are applied to your data, labels, and predictions to assign them quality metric scores.
Plug in your own or rely on Encord Actives prebuilt quality metrics.
The quality metrics automatically decompose your data, label, and model quality to show you how to improve your model performance from a data-centric perspective.
Encord Active ships with 25+ metrics and more are coming; [contributions][contribute-url] are also very welcome.

**Other core features:**

- [Model Decomposition](https://encord-active-docs.web.app/pages/model-quality/metrics)
- [Data Exploration](https://encord-active-docs.web.app/pages/data-quality/summary)
- [Similarity Search](https://encord-active-docs.web.app/workflows/Improve-your-data/similar-images)
- [Annotator Benchmarks](https://encord-active-docs.web.app/pages/label-quality/explorer/)
- [Data Tagging](https://encord-active-docs.web.app/tags/#steps)
- [COCO Exports](https://encord-active-docs.web.app/pages/export/filter_export)
- And much more!
