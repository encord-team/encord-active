# Command Line Interface

Youâ€™ve already learned how to use the command line interface (CLI) to do some things.
This chapter documents all the available commands.

To get help from the CLI, simply call `encord-active` to see the complete list of commands,
then `--help` combined with any of those can give you more information.

## Global options

* `--help`: Display help information.
* `--target (-t)`: The working directory for the Encord Active command. Defaults to the current working directory.
