:::caution

Every time you run any of these importers, previously imported predictions will be overwritten!
Make sure to [version your projects][project-versioning] if you want to be able to go back to previous model iterations.

:::

If you have your model predictions stored in the [COCO results format](https://cocodataset.org/#format-results), then you can import them as follows:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from encord_active.cli.utils.coco import import_coco_predictions
from encord_active.lib.model_predictions.importers import import_predictions
from encord_active.lib.project import Project

project_path = Path("/path/to/your/project/root")
predictions_path = Path("/path/to/your/predictions.json")

predictions = import_coco_predictions(project_path, predictions_path)

import_predictions(Project(project_path), project_path, predictions)
```
