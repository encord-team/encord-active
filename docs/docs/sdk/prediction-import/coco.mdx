:::caution

When running an importer, any previously imported predictions will be overwritten!
To ensure the ability to revert to previous model iterations, it is important to [version your projects][project-versioning]. 

:::

If you have model predictions stored in the [COCO results format][coco-results-format], you can import them into an Encord Active project running the following script:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from encord_active.cli.utils.coco import import_coco_predictions
from encord_active.lib.model_predictions.importers import import_predictions
from encord_active.lib.project import Project

project_path = Path("/path/to/your/project/root")
predictions_path = Path("/path/to/your/predictions.json")

predictions = import_coco_predictions(project_path, predictions_path)

import_predictions(Project(project_path), predictions)
```
