This is equivalent to running the [`init` command][init-docs] from the CLI.

## Initialize Project Without Labels

The following code snippet will:

1. **Find the files** that are named "\*.jpg" within your current working directory. Here, you can use any logic to find exactly the files you wish to include.
2. Specify **where to store the Encord Active project**. It is a good Idea to keep multiple projects within the same directory. That way, you can easily jump between them within the UI.
3. **Create the project**. Note that the `symlinks` option determines whether to copy all the files (`symlinks=False`) or use symlinks to reference the files where they are stored already to save disk space (`symlinks=True`).
4. Run essential metrics for the UI to work.

```python title="Initialize project without labels"
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List

from encord_active.lib.metrics.execute import run_metrics
from encord_active.lib.metrics.types import EmbeddingType
from encord_active.lib.project.local import ProjectExistsError, init_local_project

# 1. Choose images to import
image_files: List[Path] = list(Path.cwd().glob("**/*.jpg"))  # Find your image files

# 2. Choose where to place the project
projects_dir = Path("path/to/where/you/store/projects")

# 3. Create the project
try:
    project_path: Path = init_local_project(
        files = image_files,
        target = projects_dir,
        project_name = "<your project title>",
        symlinks = True,
    )
except ProjectExistsError as e:
    print(e)  # A project already exist with that name at the given path.
    exit()


# 4. Run an essential metric
# This is necessary for the UI to function properly
run_metrics(
    filter_func=lambda x: isinstance(x, AreaMetric),
    data_dir=project_path,
    use_cache_only=True,
)
```

You can also choose to run all the metrics that do not depend on any labels.
That is done in the following code snippet:

```python
from encord_active.lib.metrics.execute import run_metrics_by_embedding_type
run_metrics_by_embedding_type(
    EmbeddingType.IMAGE,
    data_dir=project_path,
    use_cache_only=True
)
```

At this stage, you will have a project that you can open with the CLI command:

```
encord-active visualize
```

For the `visualize` command to work, you need to have your terminals working directory be `path/to/where/you/store/projects`.

## Initialize Project With labels

If you have defined a `LabelTransformer` as described in [the import section](../import/quick-import-data#including-labels), you can reuse it here.
Provide the transformer and potentially label files to the `init_local_project` in order to also include labels:

```python title="Initialize project with labels"
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List

from encord_active.lib.metrics.execute import run_metrics
from encord_active.lib.metrics.types import EmbeddingType
from encord_active.lib.project.local import ProjectExistsError, init_local_project

# 1. Choose images and label files to import
image_files: List[Path] = list(Path.cwd().glob("**/*.jpg"))  # Find your image files
# highlight-next-line
label_files: List[Path] = list(Path.cwd().glob("**/*.json"))  # Find your label files

# 2. Choose where to place the project
projects_dir = Path("path/to/where/you/store/projects")

# 3. Create the project
try:
    project_path: Path = init_local_project(
        files = image_files,
        target = projects_dir,
        project_name = "<your project title>",
        symlinks = True,
        # highlight-start
        label_transformer=MyTransformer(),
        label_paths=label_files,
        # highlight-end
    )
except ProjectExistsError as e:
    print(e)  # A project already exist with that name at the given path.
    exit()


# 4. Run an essential metric
# This is necessary for the UI to function properly
run_metrics(
    filter_func=lambda x: isinstance(x, AreaMetric),
    data_dir=project_path,
    use_cache_only=True,
)
```

At this stage, you will have a project that you can open with the CLI command:

```
encord-active visualize
```
