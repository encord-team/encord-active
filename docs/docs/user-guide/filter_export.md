## Export to COCO file

The Filter & Export feature allows you to export data according to specific metric values or the tags created during the data exploration process.

After you have created a filtering rule, click on **Generate COCO file** and sit tight, this can take up to a few minutes depending on the number of samples.

Once the COCO file is generated, the **Download filtered data** button will unlock. Click it to download the resulting file.
