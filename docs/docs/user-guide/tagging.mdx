# Tagging

**Learn how to create tags in Encord Active**

Tagging is a versatile feature used in almost all Encord Active workflows, whether you're relabeling, augmenting, exporting, or deleting data.
You can tag images [individually](#individual-tagging) or in [bulk](#bulk-tagging).

In Encord Active, tagging data provides several advantages:
1. Organization: Tagging allows you to organize your data effectively within the platform.
  By assigning tags to your data points, you can group and categorize them based on common characteristics, making it easier to manage and navigate large subsets of the dataset.
2. Enhanced search and filtering: Tags in Encord Active enable powerful search and filtering capabilities.
  You can search for specific data points or filter data based on tags, narrowing down your focus to the relevant information you need.
3. Customizable metadata: Tags serve as customizable metadata that can provide additional context and information about your data.
  You can define and assign tags that align with your specific project requirements, providing meaningful insights and annotations for efficient data analysis.
4. Collaboration and knowledge sharing: Tagging promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members in Encord Active.
  With consistent tagging conventions, team members can easily understand and access tagged data, facilitating efficient collaboration and ensuring everyone is on the same page.

These are just a few of the advantages of tagging in Encord Active, and there may be more benefits specific to your project and workflow.
