# Relabeling

**Learn how to submit your data for labeling in Encord Annotate**

When examining your project data, you might come across labels that appear incorrect or are missing altogether.
With Encord Active, you have the ability to highlight such data and seamlessly transfer it to Encord Annotate, at the dedicated labeling stage for your project.
This empowers annotators to address any missing elements and enhance the overall quality of your labels, ensuring a more accurate and comprehensive data annotation process.

## Steps to send data to the labeling stage

1. Go to the toolbox in the explorer pages and use the [filter feature](../user-guide/filtering) to choose the desired data.

2. Locate and access the _Action_ tab in the same toolbox.
