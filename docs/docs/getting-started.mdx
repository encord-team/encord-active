# Getting Started

## Install Encord Active

Install `encord-active` in your favorite Python environment with the following commands:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="linux-macos" label="Linux/macOS">

```shell
python3.9 -m venv ea-venv
source ea-venv/bin/activate
pip install encord-active
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

```shell
python -m venv ea-venv
ea-venv\Scripts\activate
pip install encord-active
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

`encord-active` requires [python 3.9][latest-python-3.9-minor-version] or above and [git][git-download] VCS.
If you encounter any difficulties during the installation of encord-active, you can refer to our detailed instructions available [here](./installation).

:::

:::tip

You can also run the docker image instead of install Encord Active

```shell
docker run -it -p 8501:8501 -p 8502:8502 -v ${PWD}:/data encord/encord-active <command>
```

:::

## Encord Active Quickstart

Understand Encord Active in **5 minutes** by playing!

The script will download a small example project to your current working directory and open the application straight away.
This is the fastest way to explore Encord Active.

```shell
# within venv
encord-active quickstart
```

This must be run in the same virtual environment where you installed your package.

The next section will show you how to download larger and more interesting datasets to explore.

## Sandbox Dataset

If you have more time, we have pre-built a few sandbox datasets with data, labels, and model predictions for you to start exploring Encord Active.

To get started quickly with a sandbox dataset, you can run the following command:

```shell
# within venv
encord-active download
```

This will allow you to choose a dataset to download. When the download process is complete, you visualize the results by following the printed instructions.

:::tip
You can follow the [COCO sandbox dataset tutorial](tutorials/touring-the-coco-dataset.mdx) to learn the features of Encord Active.

### Run Encord Active on Google Colab

If you want to quickly explore Encord Active without installing anything into your local machine, we
have the following Google Colab notebooks for you:

1. [Explore Encord Active sandbox dataset][colab-download-sandbox-project]
2. [Explore Encord Active through your own Encord projects][colab-import-your-own-project]

## Import Your Own Data

To import your own data save your data in a directory and run the command:

```shell
# within venv
encord-active init /path/to/data/directory
```

A project will be created using the data (without labels) in the current working directory (unless used with `--target`).

To visualize the project run:

```shell
cd /path/to/project
encord-active visualize
```

You can find more details on the `init` command in the [CLI section](./cli#init).

## Import an Encord Project

If you are an Encord user, you can directly [import](./cli#project) your own projects into Encord Active easily.

```shell
# within venv
encord-active import project
```

This will import your encord project to a new directory in your current working directory.
If you don't have an Encord project ready, you can either

1. [Initialise a project from a local data directory](./cli#init)
2. [Import a project from COCO](./import/import-coco-project)
3. [Download one of our sandbox datasets](./cli#download)

:::info

If you are new to the Encord platform, you can easily create an Encord account by [signing up][encord-register].

:::

To be able to import an Encord project, you will need the path to your private SSH key associated with Encord (see documentation [here][encord-set-up-public-key-authentication]).

The command will ask you:

1. `Where is your private ssh key stored?`: type the path to your private ssh key
2. `What project would you like to import?`: here, you can (fuzzy) search for the project title that you would like to import. Hit <kbd>enter</kbd> when your desired project is highlighted.

Next, `encord-active` will fetch your data and labels before computing all the [metrics](/category/quality-metrics) available in `encord-active`.

Downloading the data and computing the metrics may take a while.
Bare with us, it is worth the wait.

When the process is done, follow the printed instructions to open the app or see more details in the [Open Encord Active](./cli#visualize) page.

## Running the App

To launch the Encord Active app, run the following command:

```shell
# within venv
cd /path/to/project
encord-active visualize
```

Now, your browser should open a new window with Encord Active.

:::caution

If the script just seems to hang and nothing happens in your browser, try visiting <Link to={"http://localhost:8501"}>http://localhost:8501</Link>.

## What's Up Next?

We recommend to take a look at any of the [tutorials](/category/end-to-end-tutorials) that demonstrate Encord Active's capabilities and the [workflows](/category/workflows) section to learn about improving your model performance.
A couple of example references are:

1. [Import your model predictions](./import/import-predictions)
2. Find outliers in your [data](./workflows/identify-outliers-edge-cases#data-outliers) or your [labels](./workflows/identify-outliers-edge-cases#label-outliers)
3. [Identify metrics](./workflows/evaluate-detection-model) that are important for your model performance

You can also have a look at how to [write custom metrics](./metrics/write-your-own) and how to use the [command line interface](./cli).
