# Explorer
On the Explorer page, images are ranked according to their scores.  

On the top bar, you can choose the metric to order 
your data by, classes you want to explore, and annotator to get annotator-specific information such as scores and the
number of annotations by each annotator.

According to the chosen metric, data distribution will be shown in the main view. Under the distribution plot, 
a double-ended scroll bar filters data to only visualize the selected range. In default, images are ranked in 
descending order: however, this behavior can be changed by sorting combobox. 

[Tagging](../../tags.md) feature is available on this page to tag images to take action on them later.
