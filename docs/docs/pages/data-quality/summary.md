# Summary
On the summary page, you will find outliers based on **frame-level** metrics. For each metric, we identify outliers
based on the distribution of the metric score.  

Box-plot outlier technique is used to identify outliers and according to its distance to the IQR, outliers are divided 
into two category: **Severe** outlier and **moderate** outlier.

On this page, images are ranked according to their distance to the IQR (between 25th and 75th percentiles).  
[Tagging](/workflows/tags.mdx) feature is available on this page to tag images of interest and take action on them.
