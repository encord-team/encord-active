# Importing Model Predictions

To import your model predictions into Encord Active, there are a couple of steps you need to follow:

<TOCInline toc={toc.filter((node, index) => node.level === 2)} />

If you are already familiar with `data_hash`es and `featureNodeHash`es from the Encord platform, you can safely skip to [2. Prepare a `.pkl` File to be Imported](#2-prepare-a-pkl-file-to-be-imported).
Just note that when specifying the `class_id` for a prediction, Encord Active expects the associated `featureNodeHash` from the Encord ontology as id.

:::tip

In the [SDK section](/sdk/importing-model-predictions), you will also find ways to import predictions directly from your [prediction loop](/sdk/importing-model-predictions#predictions-from-your-prediction-loop), [KITTI files](/sdk/importing-model-predictions#predictions-from-kitti-files), and [directories containing mask files](/sdk/importing-model-predictions#predictions-from-masks).

## 1. Covering the Bases

Before we can really dive into the details, we have a couple of thing that we need to cover.

:::info

All commands going forward assume you are in the project directory, if now either `cd` into it or use the `--target` option with each command.

:::

### Uniquiely Identifying Data Units

At Encord, every data unit has a `data_hash` which uniquely defines it.
To see the mapping between the `data_hash`es in your Encord project and the filenames that you uploaded, you can use:

```shell
encord-active print data-mapping
```

After selecting the project you want to print mapping for via the command line, it will display a JSON object similar to the following with key-value pairs of (`data_hash`, data file name):

```
{
  "c115344f-6869-4608-a4b8-644241fea10c": "image_1.jpg",
  "5973f5b6-d284-4a71-9e7e-6576aa3e56cb": "image_2.jpg",
  "9f4dae86-cad4-42f8-bb47-b179eb2e4886": "video_1.mp4"
  ...
}

```

:::tip

To store the data mapping as `data_mapping.json` in the current working directory, you can do

```shell
encord-active print --json data-mapping
```

:::

Note that for `image_groups`, each image in the group has it's own `data_hash`, while
videos have one `data_hash` for the entire video.
As a consequence, predictions for videos will also need a `frame` to uniquely define where the prediction belongs.

:::caution

When you are preparing predictions for import, you need to have the `data_hash` and potentially the `frame` available.

:::

### Uniquely Identifying Predicted Classes

The second thing you will need when you are preparing predictions for import, is the `class_id` for each prediction.
The class id tells Encord Active which class the prediction is associated with.

The `class_id`s of an Encord project is defined by the `featureNodeHash` attribute on objects in the encord ontology.
You can easily print the class names and `class_id`s from your project ontology:

```shell
encord-active print ontology
```

After selecting the project you want to print mapping for via the command line, it will display a JSON object similar to the following with key-value pairs of (object name, `class_id`):

```json
{
  "objects": {
    "cat": "OTK8MrM3",
    "dog": "Nr52O8Ex",
    "horse": "MjkXn2Mx"
  },
  "classifications": {}
}
```

Or if the ontology is made of classifications

```json
{
  "objects": {},
  "classifications": {
    "horses": {
      "classification_hash": "55eab8b3",
      "attribute_hash": "d446851e",
      "option_hash": "376b9761"
    },
    "cats": {
      "classification_hash": "55eab8b3",
      "attribute_hash": "d446851e",
      "option_hash": "d8e85460"
    },
    "dogs": {
      "classification_hash": "55eab8b3",
      "attribute_hash": "d446851e",
      "option_hash": "e5264a59"
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip

To store the ontology as `ontology_output.json` in the current working directory, you can do

```shell
encord-active print --json ontology
```

:::

## 2. Prepare a `.pkl` File to be Imported

Now, you can prepare a pickle file (`.pkl`) to be imported by Encord Active.
You do this by building a list of `Prediction` objects.
A prediction object holds a unique identifier of the data unit (the `data_hash` and potentially a `frame`), the `class_id`, a model `confidence` score, the actual prediction `data`, and the `format` of that data.

#### Creating a `Prediction` Object

Below, you find examples of how to create an object of each of the three supported types.

<Tabs groupId="data-type">
  <TabItem value="classification" label="Classification" default>

Since we can have multiple classifications for for the same data unit (e.g. `has a dog?` and `has a cat?`) we need to uniquely identify them by providing the 3 hashes from the ontology.

```python

prediction = Prediction(
    data_hash="<your_data_hash>",
    frame = 3,  # optional frame for videos
    confidence = 0.8,
    classification=FrameClassification(
        classification_hash="<your_classification_hash>"
        attribute_hash="<your_attribute_hash>"
        option_hash="<your_option_hash>"
    ),
)
```

:::tip
To find the three hashes, we can inspect the ontology by running

```shell
encord-active print ontology
```

:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bbox" label="Bounding Box" default>

You should specify your `BoundingBox` with relative coordinates and dimensions.
That is:

- `x`: x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the box divided by the image width
- `y`: y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the box divided by the image height
- `w`: box pixel width / image width
- `h`: box pixel height / image height

```python
from encord_active.lib.db.predictions import BoundingBox, Prediction, Format, ObjectDetection

prediction = Prediction(
    data_hash="<your_data_hash>",
    frame = 3,  # optional frame for videos
    confidence = 0.8,
    object=ObjectDetection(
        object_class_hash="<the_class_id>",
        # highlight-start
        format = Format.BOUNDING_BOX,
        # Your bounding box coordinates in relative terms (% of image width/height).
        data = BoundingBox(x=0.2, y=0.3, w=0.1, h=0.4),
        # highlight-end
    ),
)
```

:::tip

If you don't have your bounding box represented in relative terms, you can convert it from pixel values like this:

```python
img_h, img_w = 720, 1280  # the image size in pixels
BoundingBox(x=10/img_w, y=25/img_h, w=200/img_w, h=150/img_h)
```

:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mask" label="Segmentation Mask">

You specify masks as binary `numpy` arrays of size [height, width] and with `dtype` `np.uint8`.

```python
from encord_active.lib.db.predictions import Prediction, Format

prediction = Prediction(
    data_hash =  "<your_data_hash>",
    frame = 3,  # optional frame for videos
    confidence = 0.8,
    object=ObjectDetection(
        object_class_hash="<the_class_id>",
        # highlight-start
        format = Format.MASK,
        # _binary_ np.ndarray of shape [h, w] and dtype np.uint8
        data = mask
        # highlight-end
    ),
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="polygon" label="Polygon">

You should specify your `Polygon` with relative coordinates as a numpy array of shape `[num_points, 2]`.
That is, an array of relative (`x`, `y`) coordinates:

- `x`: relative x-coordinate of each point of the polygon (pixel coordinate / image width)
- `y`: relative y-coordinate of each point of the polygon (pixel coordinate / image height)

```python
from encord_active.lib.db.predictions import Prediction, Format
import numpy as np

polygon = np.array([
    # x    y
    [0.2, 0.1],
    [0.2, 0.4],
    [0.3, 0.4],
    [0.3, 0.1],
])

prediction = Prediction(
    data_hash =  "<your_data_hash>",
    frame = 3,  # optional frame for videos
    confidence = 0.8,
    object=ObjectDetection(
        object_class_hash="<the_class_id>",
        # highlight-start
        format = Format.POLYGON,
        # np.ndarray of shape [n, 2] and dtype float in range [0,1]
        data = polygon
        # highlight-end
    ),
)
```

:::tip

If you have your polygon represented in absolute terms of pixel locations, you can convert it to relative terms like this:

```python
img_h, img_w = 720, 1280  # the image size in pixels
polygon = polygon / np.array([[img_w, img_h]])
```

Notice the double braces `[[img_w, img_h]]` to get an array of shape `[1, 2]`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Preparing the Pickle File

Now you're ready to prepare the file.
You can copy the appropriate snippet based on your prediction format from above and paste it in the code below.
Note the highlighted line, which defines where the `.pkl` file will be stored.

```python showLineNumbers
from encord_active.lib.db.predictions import Prediction, Format

predictions_to_store = []

for prediction in my_predictions:  # Iterate over your predictions
    predictions_to_store.append(
        # PASTE appropriate prediction snippet from above
    )

# highlight-next-line
with open("/path/to/predictions.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(predictions_to_store, f)
```

In the above code snippet, you will have to fetch the `data_hash`, `class_id`, etc. ready from the for loop in line 5.

## 3. Import Your Predictions via the CLI

To import the predictions into Encord Active, you run the following command from the command line:

```shell
encord-active import predictions /path/to/predictions.pkl
```

This will import your predictions into Encord Active and run all the [metrics](/category/metrics) on your predictions.
