# Understanding Data Distribution

**Get insights into the distribution of your visual data with Encord Active**

 Encord Active enables you to visually explore your data distribution by pre-defined metrics, custom metrics, and label classes. Understanding your data distribution by different metrics helps you uncover areas where you might be missing data that could improve your models performance on different outliers or edge cases.
