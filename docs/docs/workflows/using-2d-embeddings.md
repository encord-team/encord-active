# Using 2D Embeddings

**Use 2D embeddings to leverage your active learning cycle**

Encord Active presents you 2D embedding plot for all your images in your project. You can use it to find interesting 
clusters and understand your data better, weakly label your images, remove detrimental images and many more. 2D 
embedding plot can be viusalized in the **Explorer** pages of Data Quality and Label Quality tabs. Here is an example
embedding plot for the COCO 2017 validation set.

You see how images can be clustered around certain regions. In order to visualize images in these clusters and learn
what is common among these samples you can use Box or Lasso Select on the upper right corner of the plot.

Once you selected a region the rest of the app will be updated accordingly
