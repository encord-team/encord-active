# Exploring data distribution

**Get insights into the distribution of your visual data with Encord Active**

Encord Active enables you to visually explore your data and label distribution by pre-defined metrics, custom metrics, and label classes. Understanding your data distribution by different metrics helps you uncover areas where you might be missing data that could improve your models performance on different outliers or edge cases.



### Setup

If you haven't installed Encord Active, visit [installation](../installation). In this workflow we will be using the COCO validation dataset.

### Steps

Navigate to the _Data Quality_ > _Explorer_ tab and select a quality metric in the top left menu to order your data by.

Select a metric to order your data by in the dropdown menu in the top of the page (e.g., Brightness or Aspect Ratio).
