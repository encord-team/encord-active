## Can I use Encord active without an Encord account

You can.
Encord Active is an open source project aimed to support all computer vision based active learning projects.
You can, for example, use the [`init`](./cli#init) command to initialize a project from an image directory.
You can also [import a COCO project](./import/import-coco-project).

The [Importing Data and Labels][importing-data] page is a great resource for more information on your possibilities.

---

## Does data stay within my local environment?

**Yes!** - period.

Everything you do with this library stays within your local machine.
No statistics, data or other information will be sent elsewhere.

The only communication happening with the outside world is with Encord's main platform if you have a project which is linked to Encord.

---

## What do I do if I have issues with the installation?

Get in touch with us!
You can contact us via [Discord][join-discord] or by [email][ea-email].

## What is a quality metric?

You can think of a metric as any function you can apply to your data, labels, and model predictions to rank or index them.
From the quality metrics, Encord Active will automatically decompose and analyze your data, labels, and model predictions.

Here is a [blog][ea-intro-blogpost] post on how we like to think about quality metrics.

Quality metrics are not only limited to those that ship with Encord Active.
In fact, the power lies in defining your own quality metrics for indexing your data just right.
[Here][write-metric] is the documentation for writing your own metrics.

---

## How do I import my model predictions?

You build a list of `encord_active.lib.db.Prediction` objects, store them in a pickle file and run `encord-active import predictions /path/to/your/file.pkl`.
Here is the [workflow description](./import/import-predictions) for importing model predictions.

## How do I write my own quality metrics?

[Here][write-metric] is the documentation for writing your own metrics.

---

## Initializing Encord Active is taking a long time, what should I do?

For larger projects, initialization can take a while.
While we're working on improving the efficiency, there are a couple of tricks that you can do.

1. As soon as the metric metric computations have started (indicated by Encord Active printing a line containing `Running metric`) you can open a new terminal and run `encord-active visualize`.
   This will allow you to continuously see what have been computed so far.
   Refresh the browser once in a while when new metrics are done computing in your first terminal.

2. You can also kill the import process as soon as metrics have started to compute. This will leave you with a project containing less metrics. As a consequence, you will not be able to see as many insights as if the process is allowed to finish.
   However, you can always use the [`encord-active metric run`](./cli#run)command to run metrics that are missing.

## How do I add my own embeddings?

Please see this [notebook](https://github.com/encord-team/encord-active/blob/main/examples/adding-own-custom-embeddings.ipynb) to learn how to add your own custom embeddings.

---

## Can I use Encord Active without a UI?

You can.

The code base is structured such that all data operations live in [`encord_active.lib`][ea-lib] which serves as the "backend" for the UI.
As such, everything you can do with the UI can also be done by code.

The UI/frontend is built in [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) which is a python based frontend library.
Therefore, you can find many good examples in the [`encord_active.app`][ea-app] code for how to operate with the project data via python.

Other good resources can be found in our [example notebooks][ea-examples].

---

## How does Encord Active integrate without the Encord annotation platform?

There are multiple ways in which you can integrate your data with Encord Active.
We have described how to import data [here][importing-data].
To also integrate model predictions, you can read more [here][importing-predictions].
Exporting data back into the rest of your pipeline can be done via the toolbox on the explorer pages.

---

## How can I do dataset management with Encord Active?

Dataset management can be done in two ways.

1. You can [tag][tagging] your data to keep track of subsets (or versions) of your dataset.
2. If you are planning to do more involved changes to your dataset and you want the ability to go back, your best option is to use the _Clone_ button in the toolbox of the explorer pages.
   This will create a clone of your entire project and you will always be able to come back to the old project.

---

## How do I version my data and labels through Encord Active?

The best way to version your project is to tag your data with the [tagging][tagging] feature as you go.

Alternatively, you can use `git`.
To do that, we suggest adding a `.gitignore` file with the following content:

```gitignore
data/**/*.jpg
data/**/*.jpeg
data/**/*.png
data/**/*.tiff
data/**/*.mp4
```

Next, run `git add .; git commit -am "Initial commit"`.

---

## What is the tagging feature?

Throughout the Data Quality, Label Quality, and Model Quality pages, you can tag your data.
There are two different levels at which you can tag data; the data level which applies to the raw images/video frames and the label level which applies to the classifications and objects associated to each image.

You can, e.g., use the tags to [filter and export][filter-and-export] your data for further processing like re-labeling, training models, or inspecting model performance based on a specific subset of your data.

[Here][tagging] is some more documentation on using the tagging feature.

## How do I use Encord Active to find label errors?

[Here][finding-label-errors] is a blog post on how to find and fix label errors.

---

## How do I use Encord Active for active learning?

Encord Active supports the active learning process by allowing you to

1. Explore your data to select what to label next
2. Employ acquisition functions to automatically select what to label next
3. Find label errors that potentially harm your model performance
4. Sending data to Encord's Annotation module for labeling
5. Automatically decompose your model performance to help you determine where to put your focus for the next model iteration
6. Tag subsets of data to set aside test sets for specific edge cases for which you want to maintain your model performance between each production model

You can find more information on Active Learning [here][active-learning].

---

## How do I upload my data and labels to Encord Annotate?

Uploading your data to Encord Annotate is as simple as clicking the _Export to Encord_ button on the [Filter and Export][filter-and-export] page.
This will create an ontology, a dataset, and a project on Encord Annotate and provide you with links to the three.

:::tip

This require you to have an ssh-key associated with Encord Active:

1. [Add your public][ssh-key-association] key to Encord Annotate
2. Associate the private key with Encord Active:

```shell
encord-active config set ssh-key-pash /path/to/private/key
```
