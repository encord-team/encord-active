# Touring the Coco Sandbox Dataset

In this tutorial, you will see some cool features of Encord Active based on the Coco sandbox dataset.
You will go through the following steps:

<TOCInline toc={toc.filter((node) => node.level === 2)} />

:::note

This tutorial assumes that you have [installed](/installation) `encord-active`.

:::

## 1. Downloading the Data

Download the data by running this command

```shell
$ encord-active download
```

The script will ask you to choose a project, navigate the options with <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> and hit <kbd>enter</kbd>.

Now `encord-active` will download your data.

## 2. Opening Encord Active in Your Browser

When the download process is done, `encord-active` will print how to run the app:

```shell
cd /path/to/downloaded/project
encord-active visualise
```

:::caution

If the command hangs and nothing happens in your browser, go to <Link to={"http://localhost:8501"}>http://localhost:8501</Link>.

## 3. Finding and Flagging Label Errors {#find-and-flag-label-errors}

You will cary out this process in two steps.

<TOCInline toc={getSubsectionNodes(toc, "find-and-flag-label-errors")} />

### Identifying Metrics with Label Errors

When you open Encord Active, you should see a page like this

![Encord Active Landing page](/img/tutorials/landing-page.png)

Expand the "Label Quality" tab in the left sidebar and click the "Summary" page.
The page should look like this:

![Label Quality Summary Page](/img/tutorials/data-quality-summary-entry.png)

In the summary page, you will find all the outliers that Encord Active automatically found based on all the [metrics](category/metrics) that were computed for the labels.

Scroll down on the main view and expand the "Annotation Duplicates Outliers" section and expand it.
The page should look similar to this:

![Annotation Duplicates Outliers](/img/tutorials/annotation-duplicate-outlier-summary.png)

The page will show you how this metric was computed, how many outliers were found and some of the most severe outliers.

If you hover the image with the oranges, you can click the expand button as indicated here:

![Expand the image](/img/tutorials/expand-image-oranges.png)

When clicking the button and taking a closer look at the image, you will see that there are two overlapping annotations on the orange.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/img/tutorials/duplicated-annotation-orange.jpeg"
    alt="Duplicated annotations"
    width={300}
  />
  <p>Notice the duplicated annotations.</p>
</div>

Hit <kbd>esc</kbd> to exit the full screen view.

If you look at the other images displayed, you will notice similar issues.

<div
  style={{
    display: "table",
    borderCollapse: "collapse",
    width: "100%",
    margin: "1em",
  }}
>
  <div style={{ textAlign: "center", display: "table-cell", padding: "5px" }}>
    <img
      src="/img/tutorials/duplicated-annotation-skiing.jpeg"
      alt="Duplicated annotations"
      width={300}
      style={{ display: "block", width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
    />
  </div>
  <div style={{ textAlign: "center", display: "table-cell", padding: "5px" }}>
    <img
      src="/img/tutorials/duplicated-annotation-broccoli.jpeg"
      alt="Duplicated annotations"
      width={300}
      style={{ display: "block", width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
    />
  </div>
  <div style={{ textAlign: "center", display: "table-cell", padding: "5px" }}>
    <img
      src="/img/tutorials/duplicated-annotation-fridge.jpeg"
      alt="Duplicated annotations"
      width={300}
      style={{ display: "block", width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
    />
  </div>
</div>

:::tip

You can find other sources of label errors by inspecting the other tabs. Good places to start could be the "Object Area" and "Object Aspect Ratio" sections in the App.

:::

### Tagging Label Errors

To tag the images with label errors, you first add a new tag in the left sidebar:

1. Give the tag a className
2. Click the "+" button.

![Add new tag](/img/tutorials/label_duplicate_tag_add.png)

Afterwards, you can add the tag to the images you see in the outlier pane with "Annotation duplicated" by selecting the tag from the drop-down below each image:

![Tag an image](/img/tutorials/tag-added-for-oranges.png)

### Exporting Labels for Additional Annotation

Suppose you have now tagged all the duplicated annotations that you would like to export for additional annotations.
Then you go to the _Actions_ tab in the left sidebar and check the "Add filters" checkbox in the top of the page.

![Select images with the `label_duplication` tag](/img/tutorials/export-duplication-tag.png)

_Note how your data has been filtered to only the rows that you tagged._

Now you can _Download_, _Delete_, _Edit_, or _Augment_ your data based on your selection.

## 4. Figuring Out What Metrics Influence Model Performance {#figuring-out-what-metrics-influence-model-performance}

Encord Active also allows you to figure out which metrics influence your model performance the most.
In this section, we'll go through a subset of those:

<TOCInline
  toc={getSubsectionNodes(
    toc,
    "figuring-out-what-metrics-influence-model-performance"
  )}
/>

### The High Level View of Model Performance

#### mAP and mAR scores

First, navigate to the _Model Assertions_ > _Metrics_ page to find sections that automatically give you multiple insights into your model performance.

The first section will give you the _mean Average Precision (mAP)_ and the _mean Average Recall (mAR)_ of your model based on the IOU threshold set in the top of the page.

![mAP and mAR scored](/img/tutorials/map-mar-fragment.png)

If you drag the slider, you will notice how the score changes.
You can also choose to see the aggregate score for certain classes by selecting them in the drop-down to the left.

#### Metric Importance and Correlation

In the next section (the _Metric Importance_), you will find importances and correlations of your model performance as function of metrics.

![Metric Importances](/img/tutorials/importance-and-correlations.png)

From this section, you quickly find that, e.g., "Object Area - Absolute (P)" has a high importance for the model performance.

:::note

The "(P)" and the "(F)" in the labels of the plots indicate whether the metric was run on predictions or frames, respectively.

:::

A next step from here would be to jump to the _Performance by Metric_ page and have a look at exactly how the true-positive rate of the model is affected by this metric.
However, we want to show you the rest of this page prior to doing this.
You can skip straight ahead to the [Inspecting Model Performance for a Specific Metric](#inspecting-model-performance-for-a-specific-metric) if you are too curious to wait.

#### Subset Scores

Before jumping into specific metrics, we want to show you the decomposition of the model performance based on individual classes.
If you look in the _Subset selection scores_ section, you will find the average precision (AP) and average recall (AR) scores for each individual class.

![AP and AR scores decomposed based on classes](/img/tutorials/precision-recall-coco.png)

:::note

We've choosen a subset of classes [`airplane`, `bus`, `cat`, `dog`, `person`] in the settings in the top of the page to make the plots more digestible.

:::

From the left plot (Mean scores), we can see the AP and the AR for each individual class.
The right plot shows the precision-recall curves for each of the classes.
From these plots, we learn that the model performs better on the `cat` class than it does on, e.g., the `person` class.
To learn for which instances the model works and for which it doesn't, you can look in the _True Positives_, _False Positives_, and _False Negatives_ tabs to see concrete instances of the three success/failure modes.

### Inspecting Model Performance for a Specific Metric

Above, we noticed that the "Object Area - Absolute (P)" metric has a high importance on the model performance.
To learn more about how the specific metric affects the model performance you:

1. Click the _Performance By Metric_ tab in the sidebar.
2. Select the "Object Area - Absolute (P)" metric in the settings in the top.

You should now see a page similar to this:

![Performance by Metric page](/img/tutorials/performance-by-object-area-coco.png)

The plot shows the true positive rate and the false negative rate as a function of the selected metric; the "Object Area - Absolute (P)" in this case.
We can see how when the model predictions are small in terms of the absolute area, then the true-positive rate is low (bad), while larger predictions are more often correct (good).
Similarly, when labels are small, the false negative rate is high (bad), while larger labels are less likely to be issed by the model (good).

:::tip

If you click and drag on the top-most plot "Select to Zoom," you can zoom in on a specific subsection of the x-axis on the two plots below.
