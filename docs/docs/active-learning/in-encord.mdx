# Active Learning in Encord

**Learn how to set up an active learning workflow in Encord**

:::note Requirements

The active learning workflow in the Encord platform is specifically designed for workflow projects within the platform.
This requirement allows for seamless task movement between essential stages such as `label`, `review`, and `complete` when utilizing the SDK.

Note that deviating from this requirement may require customizing certain steps to align with your specific needs.

:::

The active learning workflow in Encord Active consists of the following key stages:
<TOCInline toc={toc.filter((node) => node.level === 2).map((node, index) => ({ ...node, value: `${index + 1}. ${node.value}` }))} />

## Initialization
To begin the active learning workflow, you need an initial labeled dataset for training the machine learning model.
In the Encord platform, this corresponds to having a project with annotations.

### Choose an Encord project

To proceed, you should pull the project into Encord Active.
Execute the following CLI command and remember to acknowledge that you would like to include uninitialized label rows, as they represent unannotated data.
```bash
encord-active import project
```
If you require detailed information on the options available during the import process, you can refer to the [Import from Encord platform][import-encord-project] guide.  

If your workflow project already contains annotations, you can skip the next part of the initialization step and proceed directly to [Model training](#model-training).

Alternatively, if you have a trained model that you intend to use in the active learning workflow, you can jump to the [Querying](#querying) step.

### Prioritize high value data to label

If your project lacks annotations, you will need to annotate data.
While random selection is an option, Encord Active offers metrics like [`Image Difficulty`][image-difficulty-metric] to guide and optimize annotation impact.
This metric ranks images based on their ease of annotation, enabling prioritization of suitable and manageable data.

For example, you can follow these steps to prioritize labeling for data with the lowest `Image Difficulty` score:
1. Go to the toolbox in the explorer pages and locate the _Filter_ tab.
2. Utilize that [filter feature][standard-filter-feature] to select the 5% of data with the lowest `Image Difficulty` score.
3. Locate and access the _Action_ tab in the same toolbox.
4. Use the <kbd>ðŸ–‹ Relabel</kbd> button to [prioritize labeling][relabeling-guide] for the selected data.
