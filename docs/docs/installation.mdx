# Installation

:::info

Make sure you have [python 3.9][latest-python-3.9-minor-version] and [git][git-download] VCS installed on your system.

To install the correct version of python you can use [pyenv][pyenv-download], [brew (mac only)][latest-python-3.9-brew] or simply [download][latest-python-3.9-minor-version] it.

:::

## From PyPi

Install `encord-active` in your favorite Python environment with the following commands:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="linux-macos" label="Linux/macOS">

```shell
python3.9 -m venv ea-venv
source ea-venv/bin/activate
pip install encord-active
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

```shell
python -m venv ea-venv
ea-venv\Scripts\activate
pip install encord-active
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### COCO extras

If you intend to work with files using COCO format you'll have to install Encord Active with an extra dependency:

```shell
pip install encord-active[coco]
```

:::info
You might need to install `xcode-select` if you are on Mac or `C++ build tools` if you are on Windows.
:::

## Check the Installation

To check what version of Encord Active is installed, run:

```shell
$ encord-active --version
```

This must be run in the same virtual environment where you installed the package.

The `--help` option provides some context to what you can do with `encord-active`.  
If you'd like to explore the available commands in the Command Line Interface (CLI), you can refer to the [CLI section](./cli) for more detailed information.

## Docker

We also provide a docker image that works exactly as the CLI.

```shell
docker run -it --rm -p 8501:8501 -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/data encord/encord-active <command>
```

Running the previous command will mount your current working directory, so everything that happens inside the docker container will persist after it is done.

#### SSH key

If you intend to use Encord Active with an Encord Annotate project you'll need to mount a volume with your SSH key as well.

```shell
docker run -it --rm -p 8501:8501 -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/data -v ${HOME}/.ssh:/root/.ssh encord/encord-active
```

Then, when asked for your SSH key, you can point to `~/.ssh/<your-key-file>`
