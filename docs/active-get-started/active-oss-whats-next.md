We recommend taking a look at any of the [tutorials](https://docs.encord.com/docs/video-tutorials) that demonstrate Encord Active's capabilities and the [workflows](https://docs.encord.com/docs/annotate-workflows-and-templates) section to learn about improving your model performance. A couple of example references are:

1. [Import your model predictions](https://docs.encord.com/docs/active-import-model-predictions)
2. Find outliers in your [data](https://docs.encord.com/docs/active-identify-outliers#data-outliers) or your [labels](https://docs.encord.com/docs/active-identify-outliers#label-outliers)
3. [Identify metrics](https://docs.encord.com/docs/active-evaluate-detection-models) that are important for your model performance

You can also have a look at how to [write custom metrics](https://docs.encord.com/docs/active-write-custom-quality-metrics) and how to use the [command line interface](https://docs.encord.com/docs/active-cli).
