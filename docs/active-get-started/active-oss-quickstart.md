Understand Encord Active Open Source in **5 minutes** by playing!

The following command downloads a small example project to your current working directory and opens the application straight away. This is the fastest way to explore Encord Active OS.

```shell
encord-active quickstart
```

This command must be run in the same virtual environment where you installed the package.

The next section explains how to download larger and more interesting datasets for exploration.

## Sandbox Dataset

If you have more time, we have a few pre-built sandbox datasets with data, labels, and model predictions for you to start exploring Encord Active.

To get started quickly with a sandbox dataset, you can run the following command:

```shell
encord-active download
```

This will allow you to choose a dataset to download. When the download process is complete, you can visualize the results by following the printed instructions.

> 👍 Tip
> You can follow the [COCO sandbox dataset tutorial](https://docs.encord.com/docs/active-touring-coco-dataset) to learn more about the features of Encord Active.
